Proudly born and raised in Fortaleza, Brazil, I grew up and graduated from [college][ufc] and got a job.

At 28 I felt the itch to go for a Masters in Computer Science.. That's how I ended up in Northern California working for on a tech office for [The Home Depot][thd].

We work with python, java and javascript stacks.
