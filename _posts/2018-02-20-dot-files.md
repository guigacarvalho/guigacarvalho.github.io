Got ot acknowledge that my friends [Volkan](https://github.com/birkasecorba) has great dotfiles.

Personally I've always felt that I should use things as-is. Why go through the trouble of over-customizing something that was designed to work in a specific way? Why go against the flow?

Because it can pay off big time! And paying off here means: time saving, memory saving, cpu saving, patience saving...

## Customized shell prompts

$PS1 is the variable name for the shell prompt. If you run:
```bash
PS1='$ '
$ â–ˆ
```

You will have a simple dollar sign shell for that session. Usefull if you are going to present a demo or something.

## Mac customizations

There's a way to completely customize Mac OS through the shell: `/usr/bin/defaults` lets you set from the distance between icons to the scrolling direction to the usual behavior of apps such as Mail, Chrome, Finder... Here are some prety cool examples:

-- Save screenshots to the desktop
```bash
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location -string "${HOME}/Desktop"
```

-- Save screenshots in JPG format
```bash
defaults write com.apple.screencapture type -string "jpg"
````

-- Finder: show all filename extensions
```bash
defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleShowAllExtensions -bool true
```

-- Set Desktop as the default location for new Finder windows
```bash
defaults write com.apple.finder NewWindowTarget -string "PfDe"
defaults write com.apple.finder NewWindowTargetPath -string "file://${HOME}/Desktop/"
```

My dotfiles are still in the works, but if you want great references I can point you to [Paul Irish's dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles). He has great ideas and points to other great templates.
