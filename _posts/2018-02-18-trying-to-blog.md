Always marveled at the idea of writting more and gathering feedback on my thoughts. Never really had the discipline to, but here I'm am once again. 

The reasons behind this are:

>
 Document and share my learning experiences

With documentation comes solidified knowledge and with sharing, different perspectives and more learning.

> 
 Make my writing great again

Whether it is a photo caption, an SMS or a `git commit`, sometimes it's hard to find the right words, specially when English is your second language. Anyways, I hope this is useful for someone, even if that someone is myself. ;)
