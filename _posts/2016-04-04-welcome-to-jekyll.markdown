This week I started studying the String Matching problem for a class Iâ€™m taking at SCU. The Z Algorithm is the simplest algorithm known to date to solve this problem in linear time.

After some research, I have found these resources on the topic:

- [Professor Gusfield (UC Davis) classes on the Z-Algorithm (Lectures 21 and 22)][z-classes]

Professor Gusfield is also the author of one my textbooks: Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences: Computer Science and Computational Biology and explains the topic in a really accessible way.

- [This blog post][blog-post-z] with a python implementation and great explanation. 

For more details, here is the [link of my presentation][ppt-link] on the theme.
